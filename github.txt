GitHub is a web-based platform built on top of Git, providing additional features for collaboration and project management in software development. It allows developers to host Git repositories, track changes, and collaborate with others on projects. One of GitHub's key features is its social coding aspect, which enables developers to contribute to open-source projects, review code, and participate in discussions. For example, developers can fork a repository on GitHub to create their own copy of a project, make changes, and submit a pull request to propose those changes be merged into the original project. GitHub also offers tools for issue tracking, project management, and continuous integration, making it a comprehensive platform for software development. Additionally, GitHub Pages allows developers to host static websites directly from their GitHub repositories, simplifying the process of publishing and sharing web content. Overall, GitHub facilitates collaboration among developers, streamlines the development process, and supports the open-source community.
