What HTTP means
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):
Hypertext Transfer Protocol, serves as the backbone for communication on the World Wide Web. It enables the retrieval of resources, such as web pages, by facilitating the exchange of information between web servers and browsers. Through HTTP, users can access a vast array of content and services on the internet. For instance, when a user clicks on a link to visit a website, their browser sends an HTTP request to the server hosting that website. The server then responds by transmitting the requested web page back to the user's browser, which interprets and displays the content. This process occurs seamlessly and rapidly, allowing users to navigate websites, access multimedia content, and interact with online applications. HTTP operates on a request-response model, where clients (such as web browsers) initiate requests for specific resources, and servers respond with the requested data. This protocol underpins the dynamic and interactive nature of the modern web, enabling users to engage with a diverse range of online content and services.
